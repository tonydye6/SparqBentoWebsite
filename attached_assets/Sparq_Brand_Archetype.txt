Sparq Brand Archetype
What exactly is Sparq and how does the world see us?
Why?
• Brands who don’t forge such a bond certainly get lost in the sea of competition.
• Brands must develop an emotional connection with their consumers to encourage brand loyalty. 
• 70% of emotionally connected consumers spend twice as much on brands they are emotionally attached to than those who are not. 
• 81% of people are also likely to promote their favorite brands to friends and family. 
Turn the Wrench
• We began to tighten this up at our offsite
• What follows is my own branding take after adding our own special situation to the broader archetype identification process and the nuances of our strategy
• I used Claude 3.0 to take us into this further
Specifics of Sparq’s Gaming Ecosystem
• Sports based with fantastic IP
• We are leveraging the best sports IP in existence to create new sports-related games that haven’t even been thought of yet
• It’s our goal to really bring gaming to college sports and other sports IP areas where the creative openings are enormous
• Modern take on gaming
• AI-enabled and blockchain-supported ecosystem 
• New blend of Web2 fun and engagement with the rewarding future of Web3
• Futuristic as we bring all new tech to the publishing and development process
• We’ll eventually be an accelerator for other developers who want to use our platform
• We’ll have strong opinions about new tech and how it works and how it doesn’t – but we’ll always be “in the know”
• Disrupting the legacy game industry
• New way to present sports IP that makes it all more exciting – and radical; we don’t think like other people do
• Combative in that we don’t buy the myth that new tech and AI is going to ruin gaming – we think it’s going to change it for the better by using Web3, blockchain, and AI more creatively and aggressively
• We’re going to acquire gamers and fans using marketing methods which create a proprietary, better performing acquisition engine
• We’re not going to treat our employees like shit
Broader Archetypes - Not for Sparq
NOPE
• Hero “Mastery”                    We’re not here to save the day through courage in order to make people stronger – we’re not apparel, outdoor, or sports equipment.
• Lover “Intimacy” We’re not sensual, empathetic, or soothing – we’re not a beauty brand or a car. 
• Everyman                “Belonging” We’re not about fitting into a group – we’re not a retailer, comfort food, apparel company, or car. 
• Caregiver “Service” We’re not about warmth, care or reassurance – we’re definitely not a charity, health care, hospital, or university/school.
• Ruler “Control” We’re not on a power trip or commanding – we’re not a luxury car, fancy watch or fashion brand.  
• Innocent “Safety” We’re not humble and we’re not about purity or safety or virtue – we’re not a hand soap or beauty brand.
• Sage “Understanding We’re not a guide and we’re not about being knowledgeable or educational – we’re not a search engine, media company or school. 
• Explorer “Freedom” We’re not asking customers to be an outdoor adventurer – and we’re not a Jeep, outdoor apparel company, or Indiana Jones. 
Broader Archetypes - Yes for Sparq
OUTLAW
Loves Drive Fear 
“Revolution”         Liberation, Change, Righteousness, Disrupting           Conformity, Servitude, Complacency, Acceptance, Dependence
• PERSONALITY: The Outlaw has a desire for revolution partly to change the world for the better and partly for the anarchy involved. They have a disdain for rules, regulation and conformity that would remove any form of their freedom of choice (or anyone else’s). They are good at the core, but anger is part of their motivation, which can become the dominant force. Without a fight, they are lost.
• BRANDING STRATEGY: To appeal to an outlaw, you need to prove to the consumer first that you see the world as they do. Status Quo and Conformity are the common enemy and showing disdain for either will go a long way to resonating. Encouraging, facilitating or empowering revolution on the other hand, will make you an instant family (or gang) member. Formal communication should be avoided and your language and tone should be laced with grit and attitude.

JESTER
Loves Drive Fear
“Pleasure”            Fun Loving, Playful, Happiness, Laughter, Togetherness, Positivity        Boredom, Gloom, Sadness, Loneliness, Negativity
• PERSONALITY: The Jester is all about having fun and living life in the moment. They not only love having fun themselves, they see it as their duty to be a ray of sunshine in everyone’s life around them. They are optimists and can’t be kept down long due to their ability to see the good in every situation. Jesters are young at heart and continue their child-like nature long after their friends have grown up and become serious.
• BRANDING STRATEGY: Like Magicians, Jesters are rarely a buyer persona but can be a perfect archetype for brands in the business of entertaining or wanting to associate themselves with good times. Regardless of archetype and personality, everyone likes to laugh and provided the context and the timing is right, the Jester personality can be a memorable and loving point of differentiation. As the Jester Archetype your brand should highlight the light-hearted and positive side of life with a playful and entertaining spirit. Brands that are able to connect with their audience through happiness and laughter can become much-loved brands.

CREATOR
Loves Drive Fear
“Innovation”         Inspirational, Daring, Provocative, Creation, Originality, Vision, Imagination       Stagnation, Duplication, Disillusion, Indifference
• PERSONALITY: The Creator has a desire to create something new and exceptional, that wasn’t previously there, and has enduring value. They need to express themselves with their individual talent and strive to bring their vision to life through that expression. Creators believe that if you imagine it, it can be created but are often stifled by their own desire for perfection.
• BRANDING STRATEGY: Inspire to unlock the imagination and encourage the pursuit of originality. To appeal to a creator, you must celebrate the creative process while inspiring self-expression. Brands that provide the means or tools to express themselves creatively with freedom of choices would be well positioned with the Creator Archetype. Their communication should stir the desire for the creative process and inspire their customers to express their nature to the best of their ability. Creator brands leverage their audiences’ imagination and their desire to create and innovate.

MAGICIAN
Loves Drive Fear
“Power”         Mystical, Informed, Reassuring, Transformation, Knowledge, Vision, Discovery          Consequences, Stagnation, Ignorance, Doubt
• PERSONALITY: The Magician strives to make dreams come true through somewhat mystical ways. They have the ability to take people on a journey of transformation through the experience of a magical moment. They believe that we are limited only by imagination and defy the common belief of the laws of reality to lead us to a better future. Magicians have a thirst for knowledge though they don’t willingly share it, rather they use it to show their vision.
• BRANDING STRATEGY: Transformation is at the heart. The Magician archetype rarely fits a buyer persona but appeals to different personas with their ability to transform. Brands that provide a product or service that take their customers on a transformational journey (lost to found, insecurity to security, worn out to refreshed), could well consider the Magician Archetype as the personality to connect with their audience.
