Please split Card #3 into two separate cards (Card #3 and Card #16) while ensuring the following:
Equal Heights for Split Cards
The combined height of Card #3 (upper card) and Card #16 (lower card) must match the original height of Card #3.
Each card should take up exactly 50% of the original height, with a small gap between them.
No Impact on Other Cards
The layout, size, and position of all other cards in the grid must remain unchanged.
Implementation Details
Use a flex container to stack the two cards vertically:
jsx
<motion.div className="relative perspective-1000" style={{ transformStyle: 'preserve-3d' }} whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}>
  <div className="flex flex-col h-full gap-5"> {/* Maintain original height */}
    {/* Upper Card (#3) */}
    <Card className="bento-card flex-1 cursor-pointer">
      <div className="h-full">
        {/* Content for Card #3 */}
      </div>
    </Card>

    {/* Lower Card (#16) */}
    <Card className="bento-card flex-1 cursor-pointer">
      <div className="h-full">
        {/* Content for Card #16 */}
      </div>
    </Card>
  </div>
</motion.div>
CSS Adjustments
Add CSS to ensure equal heights and consistent spacing:
css
.flex-col {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 10px; /* Maintain consistent spacing between cards */
  height: 100%; /* Ensure full height is used */
}

.bento-card {
  flex: 1; /* Ensures both cards take up equal height */
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevent content overflow */
}
Test Layout
Verify that:
The combined height of Card #3 and Card #16 equals the original height of Card #3.
The horizontal gap between the two new cards matches the existing grid's spacing.
The layout and size of all surrounding cards remain unaffected.
Test Responsiveness
Ensure these changes work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile views without breaking the layout.
Please implement these changes to ensure both cards equally fill the space originally occupied by Card #3 while maintaining consistent spacing and layout.
